     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left">Vernon Howard is examplary for using rationelle to explain the invalidity of rationelle 
as well as to 
direct his audience to emotion e.g. consciousness and their relationship. He does this to show 
both meaning and destiny of life, but here I quote his '3 keys to understanding' as a beautiful 
example of using ratio to point to rartio's root (and consequently to the ultimate 'uselessness' of 
ratio):</div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">1. The world has 
nothing of real value to give you because it does not exist. Because it does 
not exist as a reality, because it is illusory, it has only illusory and worthless rewards for you. 
While employment and geography and people exist for your physical self and your social self, 
and are good for them, they cannot give benefits to your real spiritual nature which is complete 
in itself. It always has been complete and always will be, for it lives not in time but in eternity. 
In 
reality there is no individual who can win a thrill or a sense of worthiness from the everyday 
world. In a lost person, rewards or punishments from the world fall on the self-glorified self and 
cause it to vibrate. This vibration serves as a shaky idol which we eagerly worship for as long 
as the thrill lasts. But since the worshipper and his idol are the same thing&#8212;the same set of 
vibrations&#8212;the ending of the thrill of worshipping the idol causes self- panic; we feel as if 
we 
are fading away, that we will not be ourselves any more. The fear of the extinction of the 
invented self prevents us from seeing that the false self <i>must</i> fade away in order to experience 
true spiritual birth. Your work in all this is to notice the deceptive nature of your fear of not 
existing. And one way to do this is to notice how friends, news stories, rumors of doom, how 
they all try to plant fearful thoughts and feelings into your system. Here is what these people are 
doing: In order to give themselves a false sense of aliveness by making gloomy remarks, they 
have no conscience in making others feel the same false sense of doom. They are like mad 
musicians who demand that you dance to their insane music. Everything in this paragraph 
connects with the opening sentence, which is: The world has nothing of real value to give you 
because it does not exist.<br/>
<br/>
2. You need not idolize or yearn for anyone. But you must see very deeply into this in order to 
discover your basic error. You really do not admire that man or love that woman. Unknowingly 
you admire and love your own thoughts and feelings about them. Having imitation strength and 
beauty inside yourself you project them outwardly and then deceive yourself into thinking that 
they reside inside that man or woman. You will get an endless series of pains and 
disappointment as long as you unconsciously approve of this kind of self-trickery. You feel the 
need for something&#8212;which in itself is right&#8212;but then wreck the solution by trying to get 
an 
answer from the same unintelligent mind that asked the original question. You can not and must 
not answer your own questions. You fail to see that you are doing this when you look outside 
yourself for wisdom or strength or guidance. You are like the king of a castle who falls off his 
horse while riding in the woods. In his dazed state he wanders into a cave, thinking it is his 
home, even while suffering from the cave's discomfort. As his head gradually clears, he 
remembers where he truly belongs. Then his action-in-understanding guides him back to the 
castle with its true security and comfort. You have forgotten who you really are. Truth itself will 
help you to remember.<br/>
<br/>
3. Regarding acceptance and rejection, the day will come when neither word has any meaning 
to you. Such opposite states have meaning, false meaning, only to a divided mind, a mind 
looking to itself for a wholeness it will never be able to locate. Wholeness does not reside in 
thinking about wholeness, but in the lack of a need to think about wholeness. The king who has 
returned to his castle thinks neither about the castle nor the woods. To go a bit deeper into this, 
the spiritual castle has no geographical location on this earth. It does not exist in the woods or 
outside the woods&#8212;it exists above both, in a new and lofty world. This becomes clear when 
you see that a word is a word and nothing more. You need have no concern about being in a 
good light in the eyes of others. Only the thought&#8212;created self has such ambitions and the 
resulting anxieties. You cannot have either good light or bad light, for there is no individual self 
to receive it. Try handing either a bouquet of roses or of weeds to an imaginary person. It 
cannot be done. Only your <b><i>unself</i></b> can be truly Good, and that Goodness comes from God, 
Truth, Reality.</span></font><span></span></div></div>
