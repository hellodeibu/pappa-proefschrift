style="font-size:12pt">In 1985 a graduate student at an alternative liberal arts college in the USA 
wrote a doctoral 
dissertation which included the term &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; in the title. This seems to 
be the 
first academic use of the term &quot;emotional intelligence.&quot;</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">Then in 1990 the work of two American university professors, John Mayer and Peter 
Salovey, 
was published in two academic journal articles. Mayer, (U. of New Hampshire), and Salovey 
(Yale), were trying to develop a way of scientifically measuring the difference between 
people's ability in the area of emotions. They found that some people were better than others 
at things like identifying their own feelings, identifying the feelings of others, and solving 
problems involving emotional issues.</span></font><span></span></div>

style="font-size:12pt"><u>two tests</u></span></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt"> to attempt to measure what they are 
calling our &quot;emotional intelligence.&quot; Because nearly all of their writing has been done in 
the 
academic community, their names and their actual research findings are not widely known.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">Instead, the person most commonly associated with the term emotional intelligence 
is actually a 
New York writer named </span></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#0000ff" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><u>Daniel 
Goleman</u></span></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">. 
Goleman had been writing articles for the magazine 
Popular Psychology and then later for the New York Times newspaper. Around 1994 and 
early 1995 he was evidently planning to write a book about &quot;emotional literacy.&quot; For that 
book 
he was visiting schools to see what programs they had for developing emotional literacy. He 
was also doing a lot of reading about emotions in general. In his reading he came upon the 
work of Mayer and Salovey. At some point it seems Goleman or his publisher decided to 
change the title of his upcoming book to &quot;Emotional Intelligence.&quot; (For a very interesting 
and 
well written story on the history of emotional intelligence see this </span></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#0000ff" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt"><u>Article by Annie Paul</u></span></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span

<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">So in 1995 the book &quot;Emotional Intelligence&quot; was published. The book 
made it to the cover of 
Time Magazine, at least in the American market. Goleman began appearing on American 
television shows such as Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue. He also began a speaking tour to 
promote the book. As a result of his own and his publisher's efforts, the book became an 
international best seller. It remained on the New York Times best-seller list for approximately 
one year, which one can assume made Daniel Goleman a multi-millionaire.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">In his book he collected a lot of interesting information on the brain, emotions, 
and behavior. 
Goleman offered very few of his own ideas, though he did share a few of his personal 
prejudices and beliefs. Mostly what he did was collect the work of many others, organize it, 
and dramatize it. On my </span></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#0000ff" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><u>Daniel 
Goleman</u></span></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"> 
page you can read my notes and criticisms of the 
book, but for now I will just say that in my opinion Goleman basically stole the term &quot;emotional 
intelligence&quot; from Mayer and Salovey and greatly misrepresented the public about what 
emotional intelligence actually is. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">Since his rise to fame in 1995, Goleman seems to have ignored the actual research 
on 
emotional intelligence and moved even further from scientific truth. This, however, does not 
seem to have stopped his popularity as a speaker and consultant, and most people still believe 
that his version of emotional intelligence is the correct one. So many people have now taken 
hold of his version of emotional intelligence, cited him as the &quot;guru&quot; and promoted his 
misleading version of emotional intelligence that it is now difficult to separate truth from fiction. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">While I believe there definitely is validity to the concept of emotional intelligence 
as Mayer and 
Salovey are attempting to establish it, Goleman has unfortunately made wildly exaggerated and 
premature claims about what it is and what it means. After writing his 1995 book, for example, 
Goleman found out that business managers were willing to pay big money for his ideas. 
Goleman capitalized on this. He quit his job writing for the New York Times, and started his 
own consulting practice and a &quot;</span></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#0000ff" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt"><u>consortium</u></span></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">,&quot; both of which cater to multi-national corporations. 
He also quickly put together another book specifically for the business market. In that book he 
stretched the definition of emotional intelligence even farther, claiming that it consists of 25 
&quot;skills, abilities and competencies&quot;. It may be no coincidence that these kinds of competencies 
are just the kinds of things which large corporations (who can afford high-priced consultants) 
want in their employees. For that reason I call Goleman's version of emotional intelligence the 
&quot;corporate definition.&quot; </span></font><span></span></div>

what 
emotional intelligence means on a practical level and what it might predict in terms of &quot;success&quot;, 
happiness or the &quot;ideal&quot; member of society. In my opinion they have much more integrity than 
Goleman and they seem to be more interested in scientific truth than in making money. </span></font><span></span></div>

processes. For example, the lowest level branch concerns the (relatively) simple abilities of 
perceiving and expressing emotion. In contrast, the highest level branch concerns the 
conscious, reflective regulation of emotion.&quot; They add that abilities that emerge relatively early 
in development are to the left of a given branch; later developing abilities are to the right.&quot;

style="font-size:12pt">I have a few concerns about their definition and some suggestions I would like 
them to 
consider. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">First, I would like to see them focus more on the idea that intelligence is <i>potential. </i>An 
infant 
can be intelligent, for example, without being able to read, write or take intelligence tests. In 
other words, he may have no demonstrable abilities as yet, but he may have extremely high 
potential ability. He simply has not had a chance to develop his potential and his intelligence 
into competencies which can be measured by any existing tests.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">The word &quot;ability&quot; itself can have two meanings. First, it can mean 
potential, yet undeveloped 
ability. Second, it can mean potential which has been developed into something which can be 
demonstrated, measured or tested. At present it is impossible to measure pure potential, thus 
the MSC tests (</span></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#0000ff" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><u>MEIS 
and MSCEIT</u></span></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">) 
focus on only the second form of ability. (I suspect, 
though, that one day brain scanning devices will be able to tells us much more about a baby's 
potential.)</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">Second, their definition and the way they discuss EI in their writing ignores 
the fact that a child 
can start out with high innate emotional intelligence and then be emotionally damaged. (I 
discuss this further in my section on </span></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#0000ff" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt"><u>EI vs EQ</u></span></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">.) I would like to see them address this more in 
their work.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">Third, I would like to see them emphasize that an emotionally intelligent person 
is capable of 
mastering an extensive vocabulary of what I call feeling words. By mastering I mean having the 
ability to not only perceive an extensive range of feelings in oneself and others, but also to 
quickly assign the most specific label to the feeling, for example in conversation with others or 
in self-reflection. In some of their writing MSC do include the ability to express emotion as 
part of their first branch of EI, but they seem to limit their test to only a few emotions 
compared with the much broader available scope of feeling words which are available in the 
English language.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">Fourth, in the section on emotional understanding much of this is probably better 
called 
knowledge of emotions, rather than an aspect of emotional intelligence itself. Knowledge can 
be taught but intelligence represents potential before any learning has taken place. Of course, if 
one is more intelligent, emotionally or otherwise, this learning takes place faster and can go 
further.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">Fifth, is my concern with measuring emotional facilitation of thought and emotional 
management. I don't see how you can really do this with a paper and pencil test. The MSC 
team say they are measuring some of these things with their tests, but it is hard to say how 
much their test scores reflect actual ability in real life situations, or when under extreme stress. 
And these are the situations when highly developed emotional intelligence may be the most 
important.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">Finally their definition is a bit too abstract for me when it comes to things 
like identifying 
emotion in art and music. I found this section of their CD ROM test a little hard to take 
seriously when it asks you to look at a graphic design and try to guess what emotions it is 
conveying. Therefore I would like to see them test for something like the ability to identify 
emotion in tone of voice or body language instead.</span></font><span></span></div>

<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">Most writers interchange the terms EQ and emotional intelligence. In my writing, 
however, I 
make a distinction between the two. I use emotional intelligence to refer to a person's innate 
potential. I believe each baby is born with a certain potential for emotional sensitivity, 
emotional memory, emotional processing and emotional learning ability. It is these four inborn 
components which I believe form the core of one's emotional intelligence.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">This innate intelligence can be either developed or damaged with life experiences, 
particularly 
by the emotional lessons taught by the parents, teachers, caregivers and family during 
childhood and adolescence. The impact of these lessons results in what I refer to as one's level 
of &quot;EQ.&quot; in other words, as I use the term, &quot;EQ&quot; represents a relative measure of 
a person's 
<i>healthy or unhealthy development </i>of their innate emotional intelligence.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">When I say &quot;EQ&quot; I am not talking about a numerical test score like 
IQ. It is simply a 
convenient name I am using. As far as I know, I am the only writer who is making a distinction 
between inborn potential and later development or damage. I believe it is possible for a child 
to begin life with a high level of innate emotional intelligence, but then learn unhealthy emotional 
habits from living in an abusive home. Such a child will grow up to have what I would call low 
EQ. I would suspect that abused, neglected and emotionally damaged children will score much 
lower on the existing emotional intelligence tests compared to others having the same actual 
original emotional intelligence at birth.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">As I see it, I believe, then, that it is possible for a person to start out with 
high EI, but then be 
emotionally damaged in early childhood, causing a low EQ later in life. On the other hand, I 
believe it is possible for a child to start out with relatively low EI, but receive healthy emotional 
modeling, nurturing etc., which will result in moderately high EQ. Let me stress however that I 
believe it is much easier to damage a high EI child than to develop the EQ of a low EI child. 
This follows the principle that it is generally easier to destroy than create.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">In comparison to say, mathematical intelligence, it is important to note that 
relatively few 
people start out with high innate mathematical abilities and then have this ability damaged 
through misleading or false math training or modeling. I say relatively few because I mean in 
comparison to the number of emotionally sensitive children who receive unhealthy and self-
destructive emotional imprinting from any number of sources. Parents and television shows 
don't generally teach that 2+2=968. But they do often teach emotional lessons which are as 
equivalent in unhealthiness as this equation is in inaccuracy. Or we might say which would be 
as damaging to an intimate relationship as the false equation would be to the career of an 
accountant. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left" style="margin-left=1mm; margin-right=0mm; text-indent=0mm"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span 
style="font-size:12pt">At present, all other models of emotional intelligence, including even the most 
&quot;pure&quot; of the 
group, the Mayer/Salovey/Caruso model, combine the measurement of the innate emotional 
variables (sensitivity, memory, processing and learning) with the environmental affects on those 
same variables. Certain writers have defined intelligence in general as &quot;potential.&quot; (</span></font><font
