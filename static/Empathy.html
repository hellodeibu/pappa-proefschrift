other feel</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Empathy is the 
ability to not only detect what others feel but also to experience that emotion 
yourself.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">This can be both 
a bane and a boon. If you can read another person's emotions then you can 
both avoid making a faux pas and also utilize their state to move them in another direction. 
When people are in emotional states their ability to decide is often significantly impaired. Thus 
you cannot expect aroused people to make rational choices at this time.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Empathy is a bane 
if you end up experiencing all the bad feelings of everyone around you. This 
is one of the problems that therapists and other carers have to handle. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="5"><span style="font-size:18pt"><b>It's not sympathy</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Empathy and sympathy 
are very close and are sometimes used as synonyms. The easiest way 
to separate them is to remember that empathy is about <i>feelings </i>whilst sympathy is about 
<i>actions</i>. Thus you may empathise with another person and then act on this by telling them how 
sorry or happy you feel for them.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Empathetic people 
are often very sympathetic - they can hardly stop themselves as they really 
do feel for the other person. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">A person who is 
sympathetic but empathetic may appear a little shallow, as they are less likely 
to show an emotional connection. 'Terribly sorry and all that, old chap' they might say, in a 
friendly but relatively cold voice.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="5"><span style="font-size:18pt"><b>It's definitely 
not psychopathy</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">A defining element 
of a psychopath is that they do not and probably cannot empathize with 
other people. They are often good at imitating this, but in doing so they are using it in a cold and 
manipulative way.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">This lack of empathy 
is one thing that makes a psychopath so dangerous. If we cannot 
empathize with others then we are unlikely to care about them. Psychopaths can this easily 
objectify other people, treating them like 'things' and even killing them without any remorse.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="5"><span style="font-size:18pt"><b>It has many 
benefits</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The value of empathy 
comes not from understanding the other person's feelings, but what you 
do as a result of this.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="font-size:14pt"><b>Empathy connects 
people together</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">When you empathize 
with me, my sense of identity is connected to yours. As a result, I feel 
greater in some way and less alone. I may well, as a result, also start to empathize more with 
you. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">In a therapeutic 
situation, having someone else really understand how you feel can be a blessed 
relief, as people with emotional problems often feel very much alone in their different-ness from 
other people. The non-judgmental quality can also be very welcome.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="font-size:14pt"><b>Empathy heals</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Therapeutically, 
it can be a very healing experience for someone to empathize with you. When 
someone effectively says 'I care for you', it also says 'I can do that, I can care for myself.' </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="font-size:14pt"><b>Empathy builds 
trust</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Empathy displayed 
can be surprising and confusing. When not expected, it can initially cause 
suspicion, but when sustained it is difficult not to appreciate the concern. Empathy thus quickly 
leads to trust.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="font-size:14pt"><b>Empathy closes 
the loop</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Consider what would 
happens if you had no idea what the other person felt about your 
communications to them. You might say something, they hated it, and you continued as if they 
understood and agreed. Not much persuasion happening there!</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The more you can 
empathize, the more you can get immediate feedback on what they are 
experiencing of your communications with them. And as a consequence, you can change what 
you are saying and doing to get them to feel what you want them to feel.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="6"><span style="font-size:24pt"><b>So what?</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">So how do you do 
it? How do you find out what other people are feeling? All you have to go 
on are what they say, how they say it and what they do, which can also be described as 
'words, music and dance'. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">If you want to 
move someone, detecting their emotional state is the first step. If you can feel 
that state then that detection is even more accurate. When you can sense their emotion, you can 
then use this to move them in the direction you want them to take.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The trick in spotting 
feelings is to pay close attention to changes in the other person in response 
to external events. If you say 'How are you?' and the corners of their mouth turn down and 
their voice tone goes flat, then you might detect that all is not well.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The better you 
are at spotting small changes, the greater your potential ability at empathizing. 
Watch for small changes on the face. Watch for lower-body movements when the upper-body 
is under conscious control. Listen for tension in the voice and emphasis on specific words. 
Listen for emotional words.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">To avoid getting 
swamped by their emotions learn to dip in and out of the association that 
makes you feel what they do. Go in, test the temperature and then get out to a place where you 
can think more rationally.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Unless you are 
really sure, it can be a good idea to reflect back to the other person what you 
are sensing of their feelings, to check that you have got it right. After all, the only person who 
can confirm empathy is the person whose emotions are being sensed. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Reflecting back 
itself has an effect, typically leading the other person to appreciate that you 
really care about them and hence increasing their trust in you.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Empathy is far 
more effective when it is offered, as opposed to when people ask for empathy 
(in which case a negotiation exchange dynamic is set up).</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">By the way, The 
usual caveat applies here - taking advantage of someone who is upset breaks 
many social rules and negative manipulation is likely to lead to betrayal effects.</span></font><span></span></div></div>
